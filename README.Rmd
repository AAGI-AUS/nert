The goal of {nert} is to provide access to Australian TERN (Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network) data in your R session.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {nert} from [GitHub](https://github.com/AAGI-AUS/nert) with:

```{r install}
if (!require("pak")) {
  install.packages("pak")
}

pak::pak("AAGI-AUS/nert")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how you can fetch one day's data and visualise it:

```{r example}
library(nert)
r <- get_smips(day = "2024-01-01")

plot(r)
```
